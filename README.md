# VmTableApp

This is a address book application that supports:
1. Sorting by columns
2. Editable phone numbers
3. Update rows/delete rows and add new rows

Things to consider:
1. Translation: We could load a json with unique key:value mapping to handle translation. Ngx translate can help with using the json file to translate uwing the translate directive.
2. Better styling(based on given mocks)
3. API integration
4. Loaders and empty state handling
5. Better confirmations on edit/delete/update
